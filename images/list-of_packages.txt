The core tidymodels packages work together to enable a wide variety of modeling approaches:
and is a meta-package that installs and load the core packages listed below that you need for modeling and machine learning.

rsample provides infrastructure for efficient data splitting and resampling.

parsnip is a tidy, unified interface to models that can be used to try a range of models without getting bogged down in the syntactical minutiae of the underlying packages.

recipes is a tidy interface to data pre-processing tools for feature engineering. 

workflows bundle your pre-processing, modeling, and post-processing together. 

tune helps you optimize the hyperparameters of your model and pre-processing steps.

yardstick measures the effectiveness of models using performance metrics.

broom converts the information in common statistical R objects into user-friendly, predictable formats.

dials creates and manages tuning parameters and parameter grids.

There are, also, a series of specialized packages but for these I'll refer you to the Tidymodels webpage...<https://www.tidymodels.org/>
